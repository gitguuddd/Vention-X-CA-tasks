# Word Frequency Counter

## Description
Create a program that analyzes a text and counts the frequency of each word.

## Requirements
- Create a function that:
- - Takes a string of text as input
- - Outputs a dictionary/object with words as keys and their frequencies as values

## Rules
- Ignore case (e.g., 'Hello' and 'hello' count as the same word)
- Ignore punctuation (e.g., 'world!' counts as 'world')

## Examples
- Input: countWords('Hello world! Hello!')
Output: { 'hello': 2, 'world': 1 }

## Bonus Points
- Add a feature to exclude user-specified stop words from the count.
- Calculate the average word length in the text.
- Highlight the top N most frequent words in the results.

## Time Limit
20 minutes
